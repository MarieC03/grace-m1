   Rendering of a magnetized BNS system around the time of merger. 

Rendered with `PyVista`_ from a native GRACE HDF5 volume dump
(``volume_out_*.h5``).  Source data is an asymmetric binary
(mass ratio :math:`q = 0.8`) at the GW170817 chirp mass
(:math:`\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c} \approx 1.188\;M_\odot`,
i.e. component masses :math:`\sim 1.53\;M_\odot + 1.22\;M_\odot`)
on the SFHo tabulated equation of state, seeded with an initial
poloidal magnetic field of
:math:`B_\mathrm{max} = 10^{15}\;\mathrm{G}`.
