 * @brief Apply all boundary conditions and fill ghostzones on state array.

 * This function fills all the ghost-cells in the <code>state</code> array.
 * This includes applying physical boundary conditions at domain edges, as 
 * well as filling all internal ghost-zones across simple and hanging faces.
 * The state array needs to be in a valid state at all interior points when entering 
 * this function. No assumptions are made on the content of the ghostzones of each
 * quadrant and each variable for the state array when entering this function. Auxiliries
 * and scratch state are left untouched by this function, unless a non-trivial boundary 
 * condition is requested on an auxiliary variable. When this function returns, \b all 
 * ghostzones for all quadrants are in a valid state for the <code>state</code> array.
 * All interior ghost-zones operations are guaranteed to be second order accurate, total 
 * variation diminishing, and volume average preserving.
