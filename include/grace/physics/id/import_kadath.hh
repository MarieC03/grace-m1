 * @brief Minimal enum / function declarations for the FUKA-Kadath exporter library, allowing GRACE to link against libkadath without pulling Kadath headers (C++17).
 * @date 2024-08-29
 * The following is a minimal header file to include the necessary
 * enumerators and function defintions
 * that reflect those used by the exporters included in the FUKA branch of Kadath.
 * This makes it possible to only need to compile the application with 
 * the static libary stored in ${HOME_KADATH}/lib
 * without needing to include or compile with Kadath header files.
 * This is especially important since features in FUKA require C++17.

 * Code for Exascale.
 * GRACE is an evolution framework that uses Finite Volume
 * methods to simulate relativistic spacetimes and plasmas
