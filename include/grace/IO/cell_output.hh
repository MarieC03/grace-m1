 * @brief Top-level dispatcher for cell-centered output: volume HDF5,
 *        plane-slice HDF5, spherical-surface HDF5 (and legacy VTK paths).
 *
 * \defgroup io Output and diagnostics
 *
 * Parallel I/O subsystem: HDF5 volume output (3D), HDF5 plane-slice
 * output (xy / xz / yz), HDF5 spherical-surface output, scalar
 * reductions to ``.dat``, named per-module diagnostic timeseries, XDMF
 * descriptors for ParaView, and HDF5 checkpoints.  The dispatcher in
 * this header chooses between volume / plane / sphere paths based on
 * the requested output kind.
